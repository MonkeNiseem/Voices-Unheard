      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout all of our lives, we have all loved listening to music.
        Whether it’s during school or at home listening to albums all together,
        we have always valued the importance of music on our lives. So, we
        thought by creating Voices Unheard we can make a platform that always
        allows us to listen to more types of music and broaden our horizons on
        the music we enjoy. But more importantly, we think by creating this
        group, we can give amazing artists who don't have the exposure yet a
        platform that allows them to have more listeners and gives them the
        ability to keep doing what they love. Music has motivated all 3 of us to
        create this group, and I want everyone to experience the amazing impacts
        music can have on all of us.

        <h3>Benjy Beckmen</h3>
        <p>
          Hi everyone! I’m a high school junior with a deep love for music.
          Whether I’m doing homework or playing sports, I always have something
          playing in the background. Some of my favorite artists are Drake,
          Bryson Tiller, and SZA—they’ve been my top picks for the past two
          years, and they just keep getting better. My all-time favorite album
          is Eternal Atake, and I’ll never forget the excitement when it dropped
          during lunch back in 2020. I’m excited to get this group started,
          explore even more music, and share my favorite songs with all of you!

        <h3>Niseem Bhattacharya</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Niseem, and I am 16 years old and a sophomore at
          Greenhill School. My love for music and passion for coding led me,
          with the help of Benjy and John, to help create this project. My
          favorite artists are Tyler the Creator, Drake, and Lucki, and my
          favorite album of all time is IGOR by Tyler the Creator.

        <h3>John Hurley</h3>
        <p>
          My name is John, I am 16 years old and a junior at Greenhill School.
          Over the years, my music taste has shifted to encompass a dozen
          different genres of music. I sometimes find my playlists containing
          over a hundred different artists. This passion for music that I’ve
          found within myself has led to me searching for more underground
          artists so that I continue to expand my music taste. That desire has
          led me to help create this project with two of my close friends. I am
          very excited to continue to work on this project and am optimistic of
          what it could grow into.
