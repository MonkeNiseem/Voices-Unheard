      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout all of our lives, we have all loved listening to music.
        Whether itâ€™s during school or at home listening to albums all together,
        we have always valued the importance of music on our lives. So, we
        thought by creating Voices Unheard we can make a platform that always us
        to listen to more types of music, and broaden our horizons on the music
        we enjoy. But more importantly, we think by creating this group, we can
        give amazing artists who don't have the exposure yet a platform that
        allows them to have more listeners and gives them the ability to keep
        doing what they love. Music has motivated all 3 of us to create this
        group, and I want everyone to experience the amazing impacts music can
        have on all of us.
